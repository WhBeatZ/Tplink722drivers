## Supports

- Android 7
- MESH Support
- Monitor mode
- Frame injection
- Up to kernel v5.8+<br>
... And a bunch of various wifi chipsets

## Building

You will need to blacklist another driver in order to use this one.

##### With the automated script:

- curl:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KanuX-14/rtl8188eus/v5.3.9/build.sh)"
```

- wget:

```sh
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KanuX-14/rtl8188eus/v5.3.9/build.sh)"
```

- fetch:

```sh
sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KanuX-14/rtl8188eus/v5.3.9/build.sh)"
```

##### Without the automated script:

Keep in mind that the script checks your system and install the dependencies.<br>
It also checks whether the file have or not have a variable inside.<br>
As you wish to do all by yourself, the dependency list is right under:

- [bc](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bc/)
- [gawk](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk/)
- [gcc](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/)
- [git](https://github.com/git/git)
- [make](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/)
- [net-tools](https://sourceforge.net/projects/net-tools/)
- Kernel Headers -> Each distribution have a different package.
- [zenity](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/zenity)

- Compilation:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/KanuX-14/rtl8188eus.git
cd rtl8188eus
printf "blacklist r8188eu\n" | sudo tee "/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf"
sudo rmmod r8188eu
make && sudo make install clean
sudo modprobe 8188eu
```

- The toggle-monitor script:

With this, the toggle script will appear in your DE's menu. Under `Accessories` and `Internet`.

```sh
sudo cp toggle-monitor.sh /usr/local/sbin/toggle-monitor
sudo chown $USER:$USER /usr/local/sbin/toggle-monitor
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/toggle-monitor
sudo cp rtl8188eus-toggle-monitor.desktop /usr/share/applications
```

## Monitor mode

Use these steps to enter monitor mode.
```sh
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo ip link set <interface> down
sudo iw dev <interface> set type monitor
```

Frame injection test may be performed with.<br>
(after kernel v5.2 scanning is slow, run a scan or simply an airodump-ng first!)

```sh
aireplay -9 <interface>
```

## Disable Monitor mode

Use these steps to disable monitor mode. (not possible if your device's MAC address is added to `unmanaged-devices` variable under "NetworkManager.conf")
```sh
sudo service NetworkManager start
sudo iw dev <interface> set type managed
sudo ip link set <interface> up
```

If the adapter still refuses to go back, try:
```sh
sudo service NetworkManager restart
```

## NetworkManager configuration

Copy "NetworkManager.conf" to "NetworkManager.conf.bak" to create a backup.<br>
Add these lines below to "NetworkManager.conf" and ADD YOUR ADAPTER MAC below `[keyfile]`.<br>
This will make the Network-Manager ignore the device, and therefore don't cause problems.

```sh
[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

[ifupdown]
managed=false

[connection]
wifi.powersave=0

[main]
plugins=keyfile

[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=A0:B1:C2:D3:E4:F5 #Your device's MAC address here
```

## Zaid Sabih lesson tips

If you are are taking "Learn Ethical Hacking From Scratch | Udemy" by Zaid Sabih and using Kali 2022 x64 Customized by zSecurity 1.0.7 and TP-Link TL-WN722N v2/v3 [Realtek RTL8188EUS], you might find this helpful.

In the begining, I am able to enter monitor mode. However after a few days, I found out it doesn't allow to enter monitor mode. I think TP-Link TL-WN722N v2/v3 have automatically updated its driver.

Then, I find a video from [David Bombal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYnjMiTTdms) but still can't perfectly solve the issue. However, I find below steps work fine for me.

1. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade`
2. Reboot in order to load the new kernel (if downloaded).
3. `sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) bc build-essential libelf-dev dkms`
4. `sudo rmmod r8188eu.ko`
5. `git https://github.com/drygdryg/rtl8188eus` (This works for me ðŸ˜‚)
6. `cd rtl8188eus`
7. `echo 'blacklist r8188eu'|sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf'`
8. `sudo make && make install`
9. Reboot in order to blacklist and load the new driver/module.

Like https://github.com/cccooo/rtl8812au-centos-7.6, forked from aircrack-ng/rtl8188eus and modified for CentOS 7.9
as CentOS Kernel 3.10 contains many code from 4.x

# Troubleshooting
Â· You can check your device's interface by running `sudo iwconfig` or `sudo ifconfig`.<br>
Â· "NetworkManager.conf" is normally under `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`.<br>
Â· You need your linux headers installed in order to build this driver.<br>
